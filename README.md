## Overview

Week 5 explored the use of Java in reading and writing structured data formats like CSV and JSON. Students practiced using external libraries and built-in features to parse and manage data efficiently. In addition, the week covered Java annotations, the reflection API, and object-oriented design principles for building scalable and maintainable code.
